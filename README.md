# ICE 05: Websockets

Group Twenty-One (Jimmy Martella):

#

I decided to expand upon the basic shape application and make it more customisable, as in the user can control the shape, colour, and size.

#

I did the same two hour timer method as I did with ICE Four. In all honesty, the biggest difficulty I had was struggling to figure out why the tutorial/demo wasn't working, only to eventually realise it was simply because I hadn't updated vite.config.js properly, something that it took me way too long to realise. I also had a bit of trouble figuring out how to properly configure buttons to create the different shapes, but once I did it was pretty easy to add the other settings from there, so I had enough time to experiment with the colours, sizes, and css a bit.
